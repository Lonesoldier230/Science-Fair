# **VRS Optimization for Windows**

This project involves a **Visual Recognition System (VRS)** using YOLO for object detection. The following optimizations and modifications have been made to ensure better performance and compatibility with **Windows**:

## **Changes for Windows Compatibility and Optimization**

### **1. Camera Access:**
On **Windows**, the camera may require the `cv.CAP_DSHOW` argument for optimal performance. This is because **DirectShow** is often needed to access webcams efficiently on Windows.

#### **Before (Mac/Generic):**
```python
cap = cv.VideoCapture(0)  # Default camera access
```

#### **After (Windows-Specific):**
```python
cap = cv.VideoCapture(0, cv.CAP_DSHOW)  # Ensures faster camera access on Windows
```

This change helps **avoid issues** with camera access on Windows, providing smoother performance when capturing frames.

### **2. YOLO Inference Device:**
In the original code, the **YOLO model** was set to use the `"mps"` device for **Metal Performance Shaders (MPS)**, which is **Mac-specific** and optimized for Appleâ€™s M1/M2 GPUs. On **Windows**, you should use `"cpu"` for inference, unless you have a CUDA-enabled GPU.

#### **Before (Mac-Specific):**
```python
device = "mps"  # Metal Performance Shaders for Mac
```

#### **After (Windows-Specific):**
```python
device = "cpu"  # Use CPU inference on Windows
```

This change ensures that the YOLO model uses **CPU processing** on Windows, which is the most compatible option.
